*openEO - A Common, Open Source Interface between Earth
Observation Data Infrastructures and Front-End Applications*
is an H2020 project funded under call [EO-2-2017: EO Big Data
Shift](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/eo-2-2017.html),
under grant number 776242. The project runs from Oct 2017 to
Sept 2020.

*Proposal abstract:*

The capabilities of the latest generation of Earth observation
satellites to collect large volumes of diverse and thematically
rich data are unprecedented. For exploiting these valuable data
sets, many research and industry groups have started to shift their
processing into the cloud. Although the functionalities of existing
cloud computing solutions largely overlap, they are all custom-made
and tailored to the specific data infrastructures. This lack of
standards not only makes it hard for end users and application
developers to develop generic front-ends, but also to compare the
cloud offerings by running the same analysis against different
cloud back-ends. To solve this, a common interface that allows end-
and intermediate users to query cloud-based back offices and carry
out computations on them in a simple way is needed. The openEO
project will design such an interface, implement it as an open
source community project, bind it to generic analytics front-ends
and evaluate it against a set of relevant Earth observation cloud
back offices. The openEO interface will consist of three layers of
Application Programming Interfaces, namely a core API for finding,
accessing, and processing large datasets, a driver APIs to connect
to back offices operated by European and worldwide industry,
and client APIs for analysing these datasets using R, Python and
JavaScript. To demonstrate the capability of the openEO interface,
four use cases based chiefly on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series
will be implemented. openEO will simplify the use of cloud-based
processing engines, allow switching between cloud-based back office
providers and comparing them, and enable reproducible, open Earth
observation science. Thereby, openEO reduces the entry barriers
for the adaptation of cloud computing technologies by a broad user
community and paves the way for the federation of infrastructure
capabilities.
