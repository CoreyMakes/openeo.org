[This survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/openEO_UserSurvey) aims to gather a detailed view of external user needs in relation EO data access and analysis. This will enable the openEO project team to better identify current needs of different users and the potential for openEO to be useful to them and to overcome any barriers they have in their work streams. Ultimately, this will steer the openEO API in a way which meets user needs including being compatible with additional EO service providers and their data infrastructures. Additional processes and use cases will also be added where necessary with the aim of benefiting more potential users.

The survey is open to all, so please fill it in by 18 June 2018, and share within your relevant networks. It should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete.
