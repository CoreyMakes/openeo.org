# Getting started for users

Currently, there are three official client libraries and a web-based interface for openEO.

If you are **unfamiliar** with programming, you could start using the [web-based editor for openEO](https://editor.openeo.org). It supports visual modelling of your algorithms and a simplified JavaScript based access to the openEO workflows and providers. openEO can also be used in QGIS through a [QGIS plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/openeo-qgis-plugin-master/).

If you are **familiar** with programming, you could choose a client library for three programming languages:

* [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openeo/js-client) (client-side and server-side)
* [Python](https://pypi.org/project/openeo/)
* [R](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-r-client)

Follow the links above to find usage instructions for each of the client libraries.

Didn't find your programming language? You can also access the [openEO API](./developers/api/reference.md) implementations directly or start [implementing your own client library](./developers/clients/getting-started.md).

If you are missing any functionality in the API feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues) or actively start proposing API changes as Pull Requests.
