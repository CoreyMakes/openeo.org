# Architecture

The openEO API defines a language how clients communicate to back-ends in order to analyze large Earth observation datasets. The API will be implemented by drivers for specific back-ends. Some first architecture considerations are listed below.

1. The openEO API is a contract between clients and back-ends that describes the communication only
2. Each back-end runs its own API instance including the specific back-end driver. There is no API instance that runs more than one driver.
3. Clients in R, Python, and JavaScript connect directly to the back-ends and communicate with the back-ends over *HTTPS* according to the openEO API specification.
4. API instances can run on back-end servers or additional intermediate layers, which then communicate to back-ends in a back-end specific way.
5. Back-ends may add functionality and extend the API wherever there is need.
6. There will be a central back-end registry service (openEO Hub), to allow users to search for back-ends with specific functionality and or data. 
7. The openEO API may define *profiles* in order to group specific functionality.

# Microservices

To simplify and structure the development, the API is divided into a few microservices.

| Microservice                  | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Capabilities                  | This microservice reports on the capabilities of the back-end, i.e. which API endpoints are implemented, which authentication methods are supported, and whether and how UDFs can be executed at the back-end. |
| EO Data Discovery             | Describes which collections are available at the back-end. |
| Process Discovery             | Provides services to find out which processes a back-end provides, i.e., what users can do with the available data. |
| UDF                           | Discovery and execution of user-defined functions. |
| Batch Job Management          | Organizes and manages batch jobs that run processes on back-ends. |
| File Management               | Organizes and manages user-uploaded files. |
| Process Graph Management      | Organizes and manages user-defined process graphs. |
| Secondary Services Management | External web services to access data and job results such as a OGC WMTS service. |
| Account Management            | User management, accounting and authentication. |
