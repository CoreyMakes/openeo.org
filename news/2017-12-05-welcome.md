openEO is an H2020 project funded under call [EO-2-2017: EO Big Data
Shift](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/eo-2-2017.html), from Oct 2017 to Sept 2020.

The project aims at making it easier to analyse large amounts of
Earth observation data, and tries to do this by developing open
source software solutions.  We develop an API to connect R, python
and javascript clients to big Earth observation cloud back-ends in a
simple and unified way. 

We invite everyone interested to participate. Get in touch today!
