Today, the openEO Consortium **released the new version 0.4.0 of the [openEO API](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-api/)**. The following blog post will give a short overview over the most notable changes and additions to the API specification.

## New process catalogue and process graph changes

The focus of this release was the definition of a [full process catalogue](http://processes.openeo.org), which is now in implementation by the back-ends. We defined a set of over 100 processes, which can soon be used for remote sensing and related tasks. For this, we had to introduce a new encoding for the process graphs, which now allows parallelism, callbacks and more.

The following image shows visually how a user could derive minimum EVI measurements over pixel time series of Sentinel 2 imagery:

Once implemented, we plan that the following Python client code could be used to generate the process graph to send it to a back-end:

```python
import openeo
session = openeo.connect("https://example.openeo.org")
s2_radio = session.imagecollection("Sentinel-2", spatial_extent = {"west": 16.1, "east": 16.6, "north": 48.6, "south": 47.2}, temporal_extent = ["2018-01-01", "2018-02-01"])
blue = s2_radio.band('B02')
red = s2_radio.band('B04')
nir = s2_radio.band('B08')
evi_cube = (2.5 * (nir - red)) / ((nir + 6.0 * red - 7.5 * blue) + 1.0)
result = evi_cube.reduce("temporal", "min").save_result("GTiff")
```

In JavaScript it is planned to work as follows:

```js
function eviReducer(b, data) {
  var blue = data.at(0);
  var red = data.at(1);
  var nir = data.at(2);
  return b.product([
    2.5,
    b.divide([
      b.subtract([nir, red]),
      b.sum([1, nir, b.product([6, red]), b.product([-7.5, blue])])
    ])
  ]);
}

var connection = OpenEO.connect("https://example.openeo.org");
var builder = connection.buildProcessGraph();
var result = builder.loadCollection("Sentinel-2", {west: 16.1, east: 16.6, north: 48.6, south: 47.2}, ["2018-01-01", "2018-02-01"])
                    .filterBands(["B02", "B04", "B08"])
                    .reduce("spectral", eviReducer)
                    .reduce("temporal", (b, data) => data.min())
                    .saveResult("GTiff");
```

Similarly, it would work in the R client. You can also check the [process graph documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-api/processgraphs/#example) if you'd like to know how this algorithm looks as a process graph.

## Other improvements

We also updated our Data Discovery to be compatible with [the most recent version of STAC, v0.6.2](https://medium.com/radiant-earth-insights/stac-extensions-and-0-6-2-release-b0cf34272ed7). In the last months, openEO contributed several extensions to the STAC specification such as [an extension to describe Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/extensions/sar/README.md) or [an extension to describe Data Cubes](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/extensions/datacube/README.md).

Despite the process and data discovery, we generally improved the discovery of openEO back-ends. For example, the API now also allows clients to automatically detect supported API versions at the back-end, so that users don't need to keep track of that and can always connect to the same URL without worrying about compatibility between clients and back-ends. Our approach to [user-defined functions (UDFs)](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-udf) was also better integrated withing the API. UDF runtimes can be discovered now and well-defined processes allow executing UDFs. Many more improvements were incorporated into the API specification based on feedback from the review meeting, discussions with users and implementations (see the [full changelog](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-api/changelog/)).

## Next steps

This is the API version, which is targeted towards getting the first more universally usable version of the openEO clients and back-ends released. We will work hard now to implement the back-ends and clients to comply with the new API version and will follow up with a new blog post once this is achieved. Afterwards, all interested parties can use clients and back-ends to get a first solid impression of the project. In the meantime, it is already possible to make experiments with the back-ends and clients working on the API version 0.3.1. Please [contact us](http://openeo.org/contact/) to get more information about it. Having said that, the new version is not the last one and we will continue to improve the API, client and back-ends. So any feedback is highly appreciated and can be sent our way via GitHub issues in the corresponding [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/open-eo) or via any of the other [contact options](http://openeo.org/contact/).
